An assassination took place during a visit to Sarajevo when on June 28, 1914 a member of the Back Hand, a group that was anti-austrian and created in Serbia, shot the Archduke and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenburg, at point blank range killing both shortly after.

    Western and Eastern Fronts
  </h3>

    The Western front was located in Northern France where many of the major armies such as German and French, fought. The fighting in the war would end in this front. The Eastern front was mainly RUssia defending it's territory from the Germans. This front would also be more brutal because of geographic conditions.

  <h3>
    The Terms of Versailles
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Treaty of Versailles was the treaty that ended WW1. It was signed on June 28 1919. The treaty was a peace offering between Germany and the allies. The terms heavily affected Germany by demanding loss of territory, huge payments and loss of a grand military. All this led Germany into poverty which caused Hitler's uprising and his Nazi party.
